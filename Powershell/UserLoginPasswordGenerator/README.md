# UserLoginPasswordGenerator

This repository contains a PowerShell script (mkpass.ps1) created for a cybersecurity lab exercise. The script reads a TSV file (lab13-users.tsv) listing users with their first name, last name, and department, then generates a CSV file with detailed user data including:

- First name

- Last name

- Department

Login: generated by abbreviating the department name (first letter of each word or first two letters if one word) in lowercase plus a 4-digit user number within the department (e.g., di0016 for 16th user in "Direction", sav0137 for 137th user in "Service après-vente").

Password: randomly generated password with 10 characters comprising 2 digits, 2 uppercase letters, 5 lowercase letters, and 1 special symbol chosen from # + - * / & ! ? _. The order is randomized.

Exception: users with the number 10 in their login have the default password P@ssword for easier testing.

**Important Notes**
PowerShell 5 does not use UTF-8 encoding by default but a proprietary Windows-1250 encoding, causing issues with accented characters.

To ensure proper encoding and avoid issues with accented characters, save your .ps1 files with UTF-8 encoding including a Byte-Order Mark (BOM).

> In Notepad: use "Save As" and select "UTF-8 with BOM" encoding.

> In VSCode: click encoding status in the bottom bar and choose "Save with encoding" > "UTF-8 with BOM".
