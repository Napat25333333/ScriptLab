# Welcome to ScriptLab

This repository contains various useful scripts written in PowerShell, Shell (POSIX), Python, and other languages. Each script is organized in its own folder with a dedicated README.md file that explains the instructions and the tasks it helps to accomplish.

The goal is to share practical and reusable scripts that I create and use during my cybersecurity studies and projects.
